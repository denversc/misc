# Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to
# none, readline never rings the bell. If set to visible, readline uses a
# visible bell if one is available. If set to audible, readline attempts to
# ring the terminal's bell.
set bell-style none

# If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in a
# case-insensitive fashion.
set completion-ignore-case on

# Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to Emacs
# or vi. editing-mode can be set to either emacs or vi.
set editing-mode vi

# If set to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an
# ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing it with an
# escape character (in effect, using escape as the meta prefix).
set convert-meta off

# If set to On, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not
# clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless of what the
# terminal claims it can support. The name meta-flag is a synonym for this
# variable.
set input-meta on

# If set to On, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set
# directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
set output-meta on

# Set the current readline keymap. The set of legal keymap names is emacs,
# emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs- ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and
# vi-insert. vi is equivalent to vi-command; emacs is equivalent to
# emacs-standard. The default value is emacs. The value of editing-mode also
# affects the default keymap.
set keymap vi-insert

# menu-complete is similar to complete, but replaces the word to be completed
# with a single match from the list of possible completions. Repeated execution
# of menu-complete steps through the list of possible completions, inserting
# each match in turn. At the end of the list of comple‚Äê tions, the bell is rung
# (subject to the setting of bell-style) and the original text is restored. An
# argument of n moves n positions forward in the list of matches; a negative
# argument may be used to move backward through the list. This command is
# intended to be bound to TAB, but is unbound by default.
TAB: menu-complete
